To run the code, use the classifier.py file
The file is currently set up to create a few different types of models (decision tree, random tree, svm, etc)
The file only currently runs one at a time. It is set up to run random forest with oob, because that was the best performing model.
Feel free to swap out for other models and run them
Hyperparameters should all be accessible from classifier.py
The code will dump the predictions out into predictions.csv
